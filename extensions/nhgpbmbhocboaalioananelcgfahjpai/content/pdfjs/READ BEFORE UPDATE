After you update the current PDFjs Library (pdfjs-1.10.88-dist), follow the steps:
1. Copy the file text_select.js from current library to the new library

2. Replace in viewer.html file the line:
<script src="viewer.js"></script>

with the lines:
<script src="viewer.js"></script>
<script src="text_select.js"></script>

3. Search for the rendered method that is called after the pdf is rendered
(in the current version of the library, the methods is named webViewerPageRendered)
4. After the lines:
if (!pageView) {
  return;
}

add the lines:

/** call for the fix of the select text in Chrome issue **/
if (navigator.userAgent.search("Chrome") >= 0) {
  webViewerSelectStart();
}
/** call for the fix of the select text in Chrome issue **/

You're done!
