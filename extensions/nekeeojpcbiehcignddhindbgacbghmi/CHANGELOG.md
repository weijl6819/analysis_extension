# Changelog

## Soon

- Maybe: Merge watched posts and watched stories to one setting

## [2.9.0] - 2018-12-22

### Changed

- Stories now look different. You can find them on the right side of the screen

## [2.8.3] - 2018-10-08

### Bug Fixes

- Some colors in night mode were not readable

## [2.8.2] - 2018-09-19

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed disappearing options. That bug was really weird.

## [2.8.0] - 2018-09-04

- Great feature: You can now view your different collections!

- "Saved" is now "Collections"

- **IMPORTANT**: I know, it doesn't look pretty and the names is the ID Instagram uses. However, my time is limited currently (exams) and thus I found it more important to release the feature instead of waiting until I decided on a good design.

- Please note: You need to scroll to the bottom of the page, to view more posts. They will be added to the correct collection.

## [2.7.6] - 2018-06-28

### Added

- Saved items can now be removed from the 3-dots page.

## [2.7.5] - 2018-06-26

### Bug Fixes

- No recent items were added to the 3-dots page.

## [2.7.3] - 2018-06-24

### Added

- On profiles, you can now click the button 'Watch' to add/remove a user to/from your watch list.

### Changed

- Notifications now arrive as long as you haven't watched the story (either in the app or online)

### Bug Fixes

- Couldn't watch old stories on profiles

## [2.7.0] - 2018-06-20

### Added

- Huge new feature: You can now add Users to your list of "Watched Posts" and/or "Watched Stories" (found on the options page on the 3-dots page)!

  - How it works: You will get a notification whenever the User posts something, and/or adds a new Story

  - You can decide whether to get notified in background, or only if you open Instagram.com (latter is default)

  - The User(s) will have a badge on his profile, so you can recognize whom you are watching

- New Changelog page (can be accessed on the 3-dots page under "?")

  - It will open automatically, whenever something bigger has changed (so not when there's only bug fixes)
