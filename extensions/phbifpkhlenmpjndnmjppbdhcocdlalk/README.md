Introducing Followr
===================

A no-frills chrome extension to gain followers on twitter through tasteful automation.

[Download on chrome](http://ztratar.github.io/followr)

Setup takes 15 seconds and there is only one requirement: you must be logged into twitter.com.
Once you specify your interests, followr will search for tweets every 30 minutes and favorite a small amount of them.

Unlike all other bots, followr's goal is to actually improve Twitter. As such, followr will limit itself from spamming excessively and rewards you for good behavior. The more you use Twitter normally, the harder followr will work.
