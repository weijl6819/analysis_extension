  //    smartling   - the locale name in Smartling, available from the API settings in the Smartling project

  // Resource sets that are uploaded to Smartling. You can have one or more resource sets defined by file type.
  // Each set has following attributes
  //    type             - defines Smartling type for the resources. It is required attribute.
  //                       See supported types https://docs.smartling.com/display/docs/Supported+File+Types
  //                       If you have resources of several types you need to create several resource sets:
  //                       one or more for each of the type
  //    authorizeContent - defines whether uploaded content will automatically be authorized for translation.
  //                       Possible values: "true" or "false". Default value is "true".
  //    pathRegex        - regular expression that filters resources to send to Smartling. It is required attribute.
  //                       Expression has groovy (Java 7) format. See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html
  //                       Due to regex is located in JSON some special symbols must be double escaped. Example: "." must be double escaped "\\."
  //    translationPathExpression - groovy expression that is used to create a file path and name for translated files.
  //                                If this parameter is empty or undefined translated files won't be pushed back from Smartling to repository.
  //                                See https://docs.smartling.com/display/docs/Repository+Connector+-+Configure+your+Code+Repository for the details
  //    translationCommitMessage  - groovy expression that defining a translation commit message. If it is empty or undefined default message will be used
  //    smartlingDirectives       - string array with additional Smartling directives. Allowed directives depend on resource type.
  //                                See https://docs.smartling.com/display/docs/Supported+File+Types#SupportedFileTypes-java
