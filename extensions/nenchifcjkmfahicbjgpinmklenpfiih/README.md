Workspace Launcher allows users to create presets of tabs for any occasion. If you have a set of websites that you tend to visit for a specific task, the extension allows you to save your tabs into a workspace which can be quickly reopened from a new Chrome window or tab. Workspaces are capable of storing whether a tab within your preset is pinned as well. You can easily save the tabs open in a current window by clicking the Workspace Launcher icon from the top right of your Chrome window. Workspaces can also be created from the Workspace Launcher interface itself.

Create a workspace for:
- Typical sites you visit to start off the day
- Resources for a specific work project
- Sites you use for a school course
- Social media sites
- Blogs you follow
- Any set of sites you want to revisit in the future!
