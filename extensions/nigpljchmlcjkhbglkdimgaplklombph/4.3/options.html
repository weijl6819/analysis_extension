<h2>X-Frame Assassin&trade; </h2><h3>The Official Chrome Extension</h3>
  <h3><em><i>Because It's Your Browser, Your Rules!</i></em></h3> </a>
</header>
</div>
 <div class="main">
    <p>XFrame-Assassin looks for and stops security headers when they are sent to your browser from sites that wish to restict your usage. Generally this will prevent you from cross origin scripting, using media, including framing on or off the site as is the case with Google and Youtube, as well as file type sniffing when hotlinking to github files raw. 
</p>
<p>  Theres not much danger in watching youtube in a little box or a big one, the danger is the rhetoric spreading a bit out of control. The Assassin isn't buying the bull, so he's an override for much of it. Let him scrape some of that crap out of your headers. Be sure to allow him access to all sites or its impossible to do his job.</p>
   
    <p> The Assassin knows no rules, has no regard for the opinions of one website over another. He is cold, calculating and completely devoid of remorse or bias. He does not like when websites say you cannot do something and if he can prevent you from being in that situation he will. Like his ancient ancestors he values silence, and discretion, and expediency. He will if capable kill the problem header before you know there was a problem, and he will not alert you that he has done so. He needs no thanks, and is desirous of no recognition, and will always abide. Just glance at him every now and then with a look that says you respect his role, and that is more than enough to oblige him. Though on occasion he does enjoy a Sioux City Sasparella, <cite><i>"it's a good'n"</i></cite>  he says. <a href="https://rayanthony.io/extensions/" class="hover">more extensions!</a>

<p>Think the assassin isnt working? check here: <a href="http://rayanthony.io/xframeassassin/assassintest.html">assassin health check</a> if you hear voices at this link, things are good but you should also see a google banner. if not, well hang in there odds are I'm adjusting it holler if it goes on for a long time. At twitter or somewhere personal, not chromestore reviews this is a favor, not a business :)</p></br>

	<p>Millions on millions of sites inherit policy changes or mandates from Google and other leading influencers who you may notice are on a rampage about Cross site scripting and ssl/https. The former they've convinced the president is the biggest danger online. Homeland security is who combed through the chrome store and busted the israeli who owns superfish. Homeland security really? The truth is that it endangers advertisers and bad press from isolated incidents could cause profit stopping federal regulations. This is why you have trouble with iframes it may be your work software if you are in the financial industry, it may just be your favorite youtube video. In either circumstance, while the code changes rapidly I have for personal reasons over the years found my own solution. I keep it to myself so my methods stays safe. But at the rate things are changing I have to redo them 3 times a year instead of once every 3. I find a new hack every 5 months anyway so why not just share one that isnt too edgy?

 Enter the Assassin. Sites you didnt know were blocked should apear, and appear with more content, and will now work in ways they did not. Got a warning that says you are not allowed to access a site because of a security policy? If frames are not allowed, well the Assassin can likely solve your problem. Don't let it interrupt your experience. It works silently and will never add more advertising banners, boxes or ask for donations or anything, ever. I sell front side like a man a finger a phone and an invoice for $$$, I don't fuck around with $2 per thousand CPM pop traffic circle jerks. Oh the codebase is included in other products that wildly vary but if you haven't got it or just think you still need it, the assassin will oblige. ;)

<p>There is a danger, and I'm not saying some of the XSS issues aren't serious, they have been. But the number one danger is the white house open sourcing cable boxes, and enforcing cookie policies while ISIS is blowing up people at every opportunity. It's good intentions run amok and its an old story. And though right now it doesnt seem like a scary thing or very serious, it has an undeniable and adverse effect on the bottom lines of smaller companies some of whom will not be able to continue because compliance means more work more employees more things to buy, and so sometimes its necessary to plug holes, and sometimes well its easier to shoot the competition full of holes. Lets not forget when the banks fund tech companies on the value of users but they dont get results they get mad, and the compromise is qualifying users better. by triple opt-in oauth, sharing permission, spying all of it. It's still inflated twitter doesnt know if its a sustainable business, nor Medium $20 billion and you cant make money? wow. As someone whose made a couple million building and selling ad space on plugins I have a little sensitivity to watching it and as a developer and enthusiast I find much of it useless and unnecessarily complicated and I am frmo experience less likely to buy into to some things. But I get it, gotta break some eggs if you want an omelette right? It's debatable the future consequences of this meddling, big brother protecting you from yourself policies and the like, we can all agree its pretty annoying sometimes. Chrome even has a new flag in 50+ dev and canary for toggling "annoying security restrictions" !</p>

An icon was corrupted in the package and this has been disallowed from completing download from the chrome store for a long, long time. Accept my apologies, here's the fix with 4 times as many features
