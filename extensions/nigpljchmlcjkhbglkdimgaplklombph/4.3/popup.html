 <p>Iframes not working? can't link that file on Github? There's about 20 frustrating things about 2014-2016 that were just not a problem from 2005 to 2013. But now you've got a pal with a taste for old school. The X-Frame Assassin inspects the HTTP headers of your Chrome browser and when a site issues header instructions to disallow framing content or prevent file type sniffing, or similar security restrictions, he destroys them. The most troublesome of these headers anyway. Because Iframing Youtube for instance, is not "the number 1 danger on the Internet"... You can use services like Statspring.com and rawgit for proxying, or you can load a proxy on a php srver, maybe containerize it, with a node api, and well maybe sometimes you just dont want to have to or dont know what any of that means. And IT is for that reason, the Assassin exists. It's his purpose you see.
</p>
  <p>The Assassin knows no rules, has no regard for the opinions of one website over another. He is cold, calculating and completely devoid of remorse or bias. He does not like when websites say you cannot do something and if he can prevent you from being in that situation he will. Like his ancient ancestors he values silence, and discretion, and expediency. He will if capable, kill the problem header before you know there was a problem, and he will not alert you that he has done so. He needs no thanks, is desirous of no recognition or accolades, is loyal to the core, and will always abide. Maybe just glance at him every now and then with a look that says you respect his role, and that is more than enough to oblige him. Though on occasion he does enjoy a nice cold Sioux City Sasparella, <cite><i>"it's a good'n"</i></cite>  he says. <a href="http://rayanthony.io/extensions/" class="hover">more extensions!</a>
